Lets say in a existing MVC ASP.NET application stack we need realtime data connection management needed. 

Hubs comes into picture 

"Connects"

Client connects to the hub (Two way connection)


Questions which can arise

- When should we use MVC controller for some actions and when should we opt for Hubs ?
    - The balance 

SignalR hubs are single point of connection, we can have multiple hubs 

Not all the clients need to connect to all clients, the grouping comes into picture.
