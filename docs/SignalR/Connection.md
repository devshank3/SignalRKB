Conenction in a hub method is a pointer to a 

Connection 

    - ConnectionId
    - UserIdentifier
    - User
    - Items
    - ConnectionAborted

Using connection for identifier is a bad idea 

UserIdentifier - asp.net Identity 

User - asp.net identity 

Items 

    - Key-Store used to save data btw hub method calls methods 

ConnectionAborted - cancellation token
