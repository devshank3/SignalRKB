### Project Goal

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of SignalR for real-time communication between a .NET 8 server and a .NET Framework client. The client will be a WPF application that allows users to connect, disconnect, and view the connection status in real-time.

### Things to be Achieved

1. **Server-Side Implementation (.NET 8)**
   - Set up a .NET 8 Web API project.
   - Install and configure SignalR.
   - Create a SignalR Hub for managing connections and broadcasting messages.
   - Implement methods for handling client connections, disconnections, and message broadcasting.

2. **Client-Side Implementation (.NET Framework)**
   - Set up a WPF application using .NET Framework.
   - Install and configure SignalR client libraries.
   - Create a user interface with buttons for connecting, disconnecting, and displaying connection status.
   - Implement methods for connecting to the SignalR Hub, handling connection events, and updating the UI based on connection status.

3. **Real-Time Communication**
   - Ensure the client can connect to the server and maintain a stable connection.
   - Implement real-time message broadcasting from the server to the client.
   - Handle connection interruptions and reconnections gracefully.

4. **User Interface**
   - Design a user-friendly WPF interface with the following elements:
     - Connect button
     - Disconnect button
     - Status indicator (e.g., a label or a colored dot)
     - Log area to display connection events and messages

5. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test the connection and disconnection process.
   - Validate real-time message broadcasting and reception.
   - Ensure the UI updates correctly based on connection status.

### Steps to Implement

1. **Server-Side Setup**
   - Create a new .NET 8 Web API project.
   - Add SignalR to the project using NuGet.
   - Create a SignalR Hub class.
   - Configure SignalR in the `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` file.
   - Implement methods for client connections and message broadcasting.

2. **Client-Side Setup**
   - Create a new WPF application using .NET Framework.
   - Add SignalR client libraries using NuGet.
   - Design the UI with necessary controls.
   - Implement SignalR client connection logic.
   - Handle connection events and update the UI accordingly.

3. **Integration and Testing**
   - Run the server and client applications.
   - Test the connection, disconnection, and message broadcasting.
   - Debug and fix any issues that arise during testing.

By following these steps, you will create a .NET solution that showcases the capabilities of SignalR for real-time communication between a .NET 8 server and a .NET Framework WPF client.
